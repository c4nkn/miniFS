ðŸ‘€ Yep, I did file system simulation in disk environment using C. It's similar to Unix-like file systems cuz it uses INodes.
It allows users to perform basic file system operations.
- Create, read, write, and delete files
- Create and delete directories
- List directory contents
- Change current directory
- Display file or directory information
Umm, currently this project isn't fully completed. There might be bugs, errors.

### Requirements
- GCC *(if you use makefile, if you will not use it any other C compiler is ok)*

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/c4nkn/miniFS.git
cd miniFS
make

miniFS> create testDir/testFile
miniFS> write testDir/testFile text (currently it doesnt support blank space)
